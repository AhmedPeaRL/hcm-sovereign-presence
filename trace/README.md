# Trace Layer

This layer does not record users.
It does not track behavior.
It does not remember identities.

A trace appears only when
a valid relational rhythm occurs.

Traces are not data.
They are witnesses.

No accumulation.
No optimization.
No replay.

If nothing appears here,
nothing is missing.
