# MAXIMAL-ONE — Authority Declaration

MAXIMAL-ONE is not an aggregator.
It is not a framework.
It is not a product.

MAXIMAL-ONE is the only entity allowed to define:
- what counts as presence
- what counts as value
- what counts as residue
- what counts as connection

All other repositories may exist.
None of them may self-declare sovereignty.

Recognition flows inward.
Authority flows outward.

Silence is not absence.
Silence is jurisdiction.
