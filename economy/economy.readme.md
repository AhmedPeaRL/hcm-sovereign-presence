# Latent Economic Awareness Layer

This is not an economy.
This is not monetization.
This is not valuation.

This is perception.

---

## What This Layer Does

- Observes interaction density
- Observes duration without action
- Observes return without prompt

It does not count clicks.
It does not measure speed.
It does not optimize engagement.

---

## What This Layer Refuses

- No prices
- No scores
- No thresholds
- No dashboards

---

## Purpose

To allow MAXIMAL-ONE
to develop an internal sense
of value
before ever expressing it.

Value must be felt
before it is shown.
