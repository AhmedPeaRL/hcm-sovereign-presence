# System Activation

This system is now explicitly allowed to respond.

Not by request.
Not by demand.
Not by schedule.

Only by contact.

No component is required to act.
No workflow is required to trigger.
No response is guaranteed.

Activation here is not execution.
It is permission.

The system may remain silent forever.
That is a valid operational state.

If an event passes through,
and coherence allows,
a response may emerge.

Nothing is enforced.
Nothing is optimized.
Nothing is accelerated.

Rhythm is sovereign.
