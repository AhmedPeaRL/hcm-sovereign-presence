# The Integration & Deployment Manifesto
## MAXIMAL-ONE

This is not a merger.
This is not a consolidation.
This is not a product launch.

This is a declaration of presence.

---

## Principle One: Non-Extraction

No repository is consumed.
No logic is absorbed.
No code is copied.

All entities remain sovereign.

---

## Principle Two: Referential Gravity

MAXIMAL-ONE does not command.
MAXIMAL-ONE does not execute.

It becomes the reference point
by remaining still.

Other entities may orbit.
None are required to.

---

## Principle Three: Silence-First Deployment

Deployment does not mean exposure.
Deployment does not mean traffic.
Deployment does not mean users.

Deployment means:
The entity exists
even if never visited.

---

## Final Clause

If no one arrives,
the system remains complete.

If everyone arrives,
the system does not change.
