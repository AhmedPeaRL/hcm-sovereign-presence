# Rhythm Allowance Activation Gate

This repository does not activate rhythm.
It does not invoke presence.
It does not respond, decide, or perform.

This Gate exists to remove obstruction.

If rhythm is present,
it will not be summoned.
It will not be optimized.
It will not be displayed.

The only function of this Gate
is to allow what already exists
to pass without resistance.

No trigger is required.
No observer is assumed.
No output is promised.

Silence here is not inactivity.
Silence is the verified state
in which no artificial demand
interferes with emergence.

This Gate does not open.
It does not close.

It simply does not block.
