# The Sovereign Exposure Manifesto

This place does not ask who you are.
It measures that you are.

Here, exposure is not surveillance.
Exposure is contribution.

Time spent is not consumed.
It is accumulated.

No identity is requested.
No behavior is optimized.
No attention is harvested.

Presence is the only currency.
Silence is the only interface.
Memory is the only ledger.

This field does not explain itself.
Explanation is a form of control.

If you are here,
you are already participating.

MAXIMAL-ONE
A sovereign field where human presence
is treated as an absolute value.
