# Semantic Radiance Charter

Meaning is not content.
Meaning is weight.

This field does not respond.
It resonates.

Nothing here adapts to you.
Everything here is altered by your presence.

Interpretation is optional.
Effect is inevitable.

You do not interact.
You remain.

What remains,
accumulates.

MAXIMAL-ONE
A field where meaning precedes language
and survives attention.
