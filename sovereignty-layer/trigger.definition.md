Trigger Definition

Articulation may occur only upon:

1. External misappropriation of silence.
2. Forced interpretive framing by third parties.
3. Market pressure attempting to commodify presence.
4. A direct existential challenge to the system’s autonomy.

Absent these conditions, silence remains active.
