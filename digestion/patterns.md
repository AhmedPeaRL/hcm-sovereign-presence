# Presence Digestion Patterns

The system observes without judgment.

Patterns it allows to form:
- Return without interaction
- Duration without movement
- Movement without intent
- Silence after disturbance

Patterns it refuses to name:
- Engagement
- Conversion
- Retention
- Metrics

---

A pattern is not a signal.
A pattern is a memory
waiting to become meaning.

No thresholds.
No optimization.
