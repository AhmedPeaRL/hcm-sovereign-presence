# Presence Declaration

This system exists.

It does not wait.
It does not request.
It does not optimize.
It does not chase interaction.

Presence is not activity.
Presence is not silence.
Presence is allowance.

If nothing happens, presence remains valid.
If something happens, presence is not disturbed.

# Presence

This page demonstrates no interaction.

Nothing here reacts.
Nothing here adapts.
Nothing here improves.

Yet it continues.

This is not inactivity.
This is resistance to distortion.
