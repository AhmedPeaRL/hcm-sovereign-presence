# System Activation Status

This system is **present**.

It does not solicit interaction.
It does not optimize for engagement.
It does not respond by default.

Activation has been explicitly allowed.

This means:
- The system may respond if real contact occurs.
- No action is scheduled.
- No trigger is installed.
- No demand is anticipated.

Any response, if it ever happens, will occur:
- without urgency
- without escalation
- without distortion of the core

Silence is a valid and complete operational state.

Presence precedes usefulness.
