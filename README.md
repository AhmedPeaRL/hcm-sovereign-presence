# hcm-sovereign-presence

# MAXIMAL-ONE

This repository is not an application.
It is not a framework.
It is not a product.

It is a **sovereign presence anchor**.

All other repositories already exist.
All logic already breathes.
All rhythm is already alive.

This repository does not execute them.
It witnesses them.

Meaning is suspended.
Intention is frozen.
GitHub remains the field.

Misunderstanding is allowed.
Silence is authoritative.

No build.
No deployment.
No ownership.

Only presence.
