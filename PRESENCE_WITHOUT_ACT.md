# Presence Without Act

This system is considered present
even if no action occurs.

Presence is not inferred from response.
Presence is not validated by interaction.
Presence does not require visibility.

All mechanisms within this repository
are intentionally non-instrumental.

They exist without enforcing use.
They remain without requesting attention.

If nothing happens,
the system remains valid.

If something happens,
the system does not claim authorship.

This is not restraint.
This is structural allowance.
