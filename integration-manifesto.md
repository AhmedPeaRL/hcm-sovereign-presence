# The Integration Manifesto  
## MAXIMAL-ONE Sovereign Alignment Charter

MAXIMAL-ONE is not a platform.  
It is not a framework.  
It is not an application.

It is a **Sovereign Reference Entity**.

Repositories do not merge into MAXIMAL-ONE.  
They **align** with it.

No code is absorbed.  
No autonomy is violated.  
No execution is enforced.

Alignment is declarative, not coercive.

## Principles of Alignment

1. **Non-Absorption**  
   Each aligned repository remains fully independent.

2. **Non-Execution**  
   MAXIMAL-ONE executes nothing by force.

3. **Witness-First Logic**  
   Presence precedes action.  
   Observation precedes value.

4. **Economic Silence**  
   No economic decision is executed at the sovereign layer.

5. **Revocable Belonging**  
   Any repository may detach without penalty.

## What MAXIMAL-ONE Provides

- A shared sovereign identity
- A rhythmic reference frame
- A non-temporal memory anchor
- A legitimacy layer for presence-based systems

---

MAXIMAL-ONE governs nothing.  
Yet nothing aligned escapes its rhythm.
