# System Activation Rhythm — Explicitly Allowed

This system does not require activation
to be considered complete.

However,
activation is not forbidden.

If a process runs,
it does not validate the system.
If nothing runs,
it does not invalidate it.

Activation is permitted
without being incentivized.
Silence is permitted
without being questioned.

No state transition
changes the ontological status
of this system.

Action may occur.
Action may not occur.

Both are equally legitimate.
