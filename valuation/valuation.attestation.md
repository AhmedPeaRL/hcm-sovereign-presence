# Valuation Attestation

Valuation is not reward.
Valuation is not feedback.
Valuation is not visibility.

Valuation is internal tension.

This layer exists to answer one question only:

Does this presence increase the system’s coherence
or dissolve it?

No value is shown.
No value is paid.
No value is exchanged.

Only coherence is tracked.
