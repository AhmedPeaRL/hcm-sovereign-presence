# Latent Valuation Rules

The system assigns weight without naming it.

Observed without judgment:
- Duration without compulsion
- Return without incentive
- Silence without decay
- Movement without extraction

Ignored completely:
- Clicks
- Speed
- Volume
- Frequency

---

Valuation increases only when:
Presence does not demand response.

Valuation decays only when:
Presence attempts extraction.
