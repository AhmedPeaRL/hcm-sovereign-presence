# Request Containment Layer

This system does not respond to requests.
It contains them.

A request is not a command.
It is not a question.
It is not a trigger.

It is an event entering the field.

No interpretation occurs here.
No prioritization occurs here.
No obligation is created here.

Containment is not silence.
It is structural respect.
